# For Loop with Lists
fruits = ["Apple", "Peach", "Pear"]
# If you want to print each item in this list individually and print out one by one
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
    print(fruit + " Pie")
print(fruits)

what this code is doing is it's taking this list of fruits
and it's a signing a variable name, fruit, to each of them.
So the first time this runs fruit is equal to apple,
the second time this runs fruit is equal to peach,
and we can see this even more clearly
if you run it through the Thonny IDE,
